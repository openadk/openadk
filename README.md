# OpenADK (Open Agent Development Kit)

A development toolkit that enhances Claude Code with specialized AI agents and multi-repository workflows for professional software development.

## üéØ Vision

**Our vision is to enhance AI-assisted development by providing a free, open-source toolkit that brings enterprise-grade multi-agent workflows to developers using AI coding assistants.**

We believe that:
- Developers using AI assistants should have access to sophisticated multi-agent workflows without additional costs
- Your AI configuration and workflows should be portable, customizable, and under your control
- The future of development is multi-agent collaboration, where specialized AI agents work together on different aspects of your code
- Open-source tools can dramatically amplify the capabilities of existing AI assistants

### Current Focus: Claude Code
OpenADK is currently optimized for Claude Code users, providing deep integration and specialized workflows. *Requires a Claude Code subscription.*

### Future: Model-Agnostic Platform
Our long-term vision is to make OpenADK a **universal enhancement layer** that works with any AI coding assistant:
- Support for multiple AI CLIs (Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and others)
- Unified agent definitions that adapt to different models
- Consistent multi-repository workflows across platforms
- Write once, enhance any AI assistant

This model-agnostic approach ensures your investment in workflows and configurations remains valuable regardless of which AI assistant you choose.

## ü§ñ Claude Code Integration

OpenADK provides deep integration with Claude Code, offering:
- **Multi-repository context management** - Work across multiple repos seamlessly
- **Specialized AI agents** - Development, Security, testing, architecture, DevOps, and more
- **Automated code review** - Pre-commit hooks with agent-based reviews
- **Dynamic project discovery** - Automatically understands your project structure

## ‚ö° Get Started with OpenADK

1. **Clone OpenADK in your parent directory** (next to your project repositories):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-org]/openadk.git
   ```
   
   Your structure should look like:
   ```
   parent-directory/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ openadk/         # This repository
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-repo-1/     # Your application repositories
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-repo-2/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .../
   ```

2. **Start Claude Code**
   ```bash
   cd openadk
   claude
   ```

3. **Initialize - Two Options**
   
   **Option A: Work with all repositories**
   Type `start` and Claude will:
   - Discover all repositories in the parent directory
   - Check their status
   - Provide intelligent assistance across all repos
   
   **Option B: Work with specific repositories only**
   Type `start [repo1] [repo2]` (e.g., `start backend frontend`) and Claude will:
   - Work only with the specified repositories
   - Ignore other repositories in the parent directory
   - Focus assistance on your selected repos
