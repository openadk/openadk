# Project Working Directory

The `_project/` directory serves as the **central workspace** for project-specific documentation and AI agent outputs. It's positioned at the top of your file explorer for easy access.

## 📁 Purpose
This directory contains:
- **Project context** (PROJECT_CONTEXT.yaml) - Auto-generated project understanding
- **Requirements & specifications** - Feature documentation
- **Review reports** - Code quality and security assessments
- **Architecture decisions** - Technical design documents
- **Test reports** - Coverage and test results
- **Planning documents** - Sprint plans and task breakdowns

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT
- **Templates** (TEMPLATE_*.md/yaml) are tracked in git and can be improved
- **Generated files** (with timestamps) are git-ignored
- This is a working directory for both human reference and agent outputs
- The PROJECT_CONTEXT.yaml file is auto-generated by the `start` command

## Directory Structure

### 📝 `/requirements/`
Requirements specifications generated by the requirements-analyst agent:
- Feature specifications
- User stories
- Acceptance criteria
- API contracts

### 🔍 `/reviews/`
Review reports from various agents:
- Code reviews (code-reviewer)
- Security audits (security-expert)
- Performance assessments
- PR review summaries

### 🏗️ `/architecture/`
Architecture documentation from system-architect:
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- System design documents
- Technology evaluations
- Scaling strategies

### 🧪 `/tests/`
Test-related artifacts from test-engineer:
- Test coverage reports
- Test plans
- Test execution results
- Performance benchmarks

### 📊 `/planning/`
Project management artifacts from project-manager:
- Sprint plans
- Task breakdowns
- Workflow diagrams
- Resource allocations

### 📈 `/reports/`
General reports and summaries:
- Multi-agent collaboration results
- Project health reports
- Dependency analyses
- Migration plans

## File Naming Convention

Files are named with timestamps and descriptive names:
```
YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_[agent-name]_[description].[ext]
```

Example:
```
2025-01-15_14-30_requirements-analyst_user-auth-feature.md
2025-01-15_15-45_security-expert_api-security-review.yaml
```

## Why These Are Git-Ignored

1. **Generated Content**: These are outputs, not source code
2. **Personal Workspace**: Different developers may generate different reports
3. **Temporal Nature**: Reports are point-in-time snapshots
4. **Size Concerns**: Reports can be large and shouldn't bloat the repository

## Accessing Historical Reports

While not in git, important reports should be:
1. Summarized in commit messages
2. Referenced in PR descriptions
3. Extracted to permanent documentation if needed
4. Stored in external documentation systems for long-term retention
