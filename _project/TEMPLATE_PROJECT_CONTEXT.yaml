# Template for PROJECT_CONTEXT.yaml
# This file is auto-generated by Claude Code when you run "start"
# DO NOT EDIT THIS TEMPLATE - it's just an example of the structure
#
# The actual PROJECT_CONTEXT.yaml is generated dynamically based on:
# - Repositories discovered in the parent directory
# - Each repository's technology stack
# - Current git status
# - Available agents and configurations
#
# This file is .gitignored and should never be committed
